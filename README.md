# Github-Training

## Project Description
This repository serves as a practical demonstration of Git and GitHub workflow best practices. It showcases the importance of using feature branches for collaborative development and safe code management.

## Features
- Git workflow demonstration
- Branch management examples
- Pull request workflow
- Collaborative development practices

## Why Use Feature Branches?
Working directly on the main branch can lead to several issues:
- **Collaboration conflicts**: Multiple developers working on main simultaneously can cause merge conflicts
- **Rollback difficulties**: Changes mixed together make it hard to revert specific features
- **Code review challenges**: No clear separation of changes for review
- **Production risks**: Unstable code can accidentally reach the main branch

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Create a feature branch for your changes
3. Make your changes and commit with meaningful messages
4. Push your branch and create a pull request
5. Get code review and merge when approved

## Best Practices
- Always create feature branches for new work
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep branches focused on single features
- Use pull requests for code review
- Test changes before merging to main
